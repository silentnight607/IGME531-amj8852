While I could have implimented the translate part I knew 
if I rotated at different points inside of the square it 
would also give me the desired results so I went with 
that instead since it made things a lot easier.

I also started off using the code from the Des Ordres
since it was so similar. and messed with how the rotation
was done so it would look like the squares were placed
more randomly. I then made it so that the column number changed
how much it rotated and then played with numbers until I got the
right one.

And for the variation I decided to make the rectangles get smaller
as it went downward with slight randomness. Which is a little
unorriginal but done at 5 in the morning.
