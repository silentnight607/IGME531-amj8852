Inspired by the Des Ordres artwork.

The main pain point I had was getting the scaling to 
work for the rectangles since I had to move them to a 
portion of their spot.

I didn't have much creative juices flowing so I just 
thought what if I increased the size that they could 
be and had a chance of being circles. I ended up 
really liking the random circles so I just saved that 
as another version.
